This is why Trump pulled out of the Iran Nuke deal, and Biden put it back in along with lifting up Iran sanctions. Iran is afloat with cash to terrorize that part of the world and has already sent thousands of Iranian terrorists through Biden's open borders.  The CCP is doing the same--sending military age men across our borders. Biden and Newsom are sleeping at the wheel with more important things to think about like \"gender studies\" in the military.\n",

      "What does anyone think the IDF is in Gaza to do? Redesign the neighborhoods? No--they're there to KILL HAMAS. All of them. That's been the entire game plan since the day they began the war there.\n",
      "Those who want to have a cease fire, or to stop the killing, all they need to do is convince Hamas to give up the fight and turn themselves in to the IDF, every last Hamas fighter. Then, and only then, will the fighting cease. Israel is there in Gaza for one purpose: end Hamas, PERIOD.\n",

      "If Hamas surrenders, giving up the fight and turning themselves in, you think Hezbollah, Iran and its proxies won't carry on the Hamas fight.  This is why Trump pulled out of the Iran Nuke deal, and Biden put it back in along with lifting up Iran sanctions. Iran is afloat with cash to terrorize that part of the world and has already sent thousands of Iranian terrorists through Biden's open borders.  The CCP is doing the same--sending military age men across our borders. Biden and Newsom are sleeping at the wheel with more important things to think about like \"gender studies\" in the military.\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nA group of Democrats who started a movement in opposition to President Biden\\'s support for Israel\\'s war in Gaza sent a clear message in the Michigan primary, exceeding the amount of votes the group was aiming for and complicating the key battleground state ahead of this year\\'s general election.\\n\\n\"Yesterday was a resounding victory,\" Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who joined the \"Listen to Michigan\" movement, said during a news conference Wednesday claiming victory for the movement.\\n\\nThe comments come following the movement\\'s push to have Democratic voters select \"uncommitted\" in Tuesday\\'s Democratic primary surpassed the group\\'s expectations, with just over 101,000 people selecting the option, according to Associated Press numbers as of Wednesday afternoon. That mark was more than 10 times the group\\'s stated goal, which was to get 10,000 people, or roughly the same as the margin of victory in the 2016 election in the state, to select the option.\\n\\nPOLL SHOWS BIDEN\\'S LEAD OVER TRUMP SHRINKING IN 2024 MATCHUP AS CONCERNS OVER PHYSICAL FITNESS GROW\\n\\nDespite the apparent resounding success, Biden easily captured the state and gained 115 delegates while hauling in over 81% of the vote, further solidifying his grasp on the nomination and setting up a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in November.\\n\\n\"I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,\" Biden said in a statement after the Michigan victory while warning that there is \"much left to do\" to defeat Trump in November. \"You’ve heard me say many times it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America. It’s never a good bet to bet against Michiganders either. This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together. I know that we will.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Listen to Michigan supporters have warned they are willing to continue growing the movement ahead of the general election, a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.\\n\\nJAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER \\'UNCOMMITTED\\' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: \\'HUGE PROBLEM\\'\\n\\nReached for comment by Fox News Digital, a Biden campaign spokesperson noted that the share of uncommitted votes, 11%, was actually in line with the previous time an incumbent was on the ballot in the state in a Democratic primary, which was during the 2012 re-election campaign of Former President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the spokesperson stressed that the campaign is still working hard to earn the votes of holdouts and will continue working towards peace in Gaza.\\n\\nBut the movement started by Listen to Michigan may not be in Biden\\'s rearview mirror after Michigan, with the group saying activists in future primary states have reached out about joining the cause.\\n\\n\"Two of the states where organizers have reached out specifically are Minnesota and Washington State,\" a Listen to Michigan spokesperson said during Wednesday\\'s news conference. \"We have our eye on those states… and are ready to have conversations with anybody organizing for an anti-war future.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe organization has also brushed off suggestions that it may at least indirectly help Trump regain the presidency, arguing that it is up to Biden to earn their votes.\\n\\n\"We are not electing Donald Trump. President Biden is the one seeking the highest office, and he is the candidate who\\'s facing off against Donald Trump,\" Hammoud said. \"He has to earn the votes of the constituency that he\\'s trying to serve.\"', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}}, {'title': \"Hamas officials shut down Biden's ice cream diplomacy, rejects cease-fire deal\", 'top_image': 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/Biden-Ice-Cream.jpg', 'images': ['https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Just-Stop-Oil-compilation.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/hunter_biden_deposition_getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png', 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/Biden-Ice-Cream.jpg', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/Biden-Ice-Cream.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/AP24059679895953.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/tank-Israel-Hamas-war.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/348/196/Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/1200/675/GettyImages-1944714824.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/133a9053-4fec-4aa4-a4e7-ca51bc0705f0/c63b5e90-e829-4004-a230-40cd4e013894/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hamas-officials-shut-down-bidens-ice-cream-diplomacy-rejects-cease-fire-deal', 'date': 'Wed, 28 Feb 2024 12:05:00 GMT', 'short_description': \"Hamas officials shut down Biden's ice cream diplomacy, rejects cease-fire deal  Fox News\", 'text': 'Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge.

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.\\n\\nThe case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a \"bump stock\" device is a \"machine gun\" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires \"automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.\"\\n\\nAfter a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that \"bump stocks\" are machine guns.\\n\\nThe Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.\\n\\nGOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN\\'S \\'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA\\': \\'EXTREMIST POLICIES\\'\\n\\nMichael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several \"bump stocks\" under the ATF\\'s rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.\\n\\n\"It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That\\'s going to be a job that\\'s reserved for Congress ,\" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\\n\\nThe conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.\\n\\nBut the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.\\n\\nThe justices\\' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.\\n\\n\"I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we\\'re dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,\" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.\"\\n\\nJustice Samuel Alito called that \"disturbing.\"\\n\\n\"These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,\" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"It\\'s really not about the operation of the thing. It\\'s about what it can achieve, what it\\'s being used for...

Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.\\n\\nBoth sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.\\n\\nThe government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire \"automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\"\\n\\nLawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.\\n\\n\"The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,\" said Justice Elena Kagan. \"So I don\\'t understand why it\\'s any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.\"\\n\\nAfter attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, \"Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?\"\\n\\nBut other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it\\'s functioning like a machine gun would,\" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, \"but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn\\'t Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?\"\\n\\nThe technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.\\n\\n\"This is totally confusing,\" said Alito at one point.

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nThe murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the \"direct result\" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.\\n\\n\"It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,\" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.\\n\\nGeorgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia’s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.\\n\\nIbarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border \"parole,\" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and \"charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,\" according to ICE.\\n\\n7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES\\n\\nThe NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra\\'s arrest.\\n\\nTypically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.\\n\\nIn Ibarra’s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.\\n\\nNew York City, however, is a \"sanctuary city\" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.\\n\\nLAKEN RILEY CASE: HECKLERS SHOUT DOWN ATHENS MAYOR AS HE DENIES SANCTUARY CITY, ANNOUNCES PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDS\\n\\n\"A woman is dead in Georgia because the New York City Council passed local laws barring the NYPD from cooperating with ICE, and as such the suspect was released without any notification to federal law enforcement,\" Borelli tweeted this week, accompanied by a list of laws that restricted local cooperation with the immigration agency.\\n\\nUnder a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions. The DOC, for example, is only allowed to comply with an ICE detainer if it is accompanied by a warrant from a federal judge and if the suspect has been convicted of a violent crime in the last five years.\\n\\nLAKEN RILEY MURDER IGNITES DEMANDS TO HIRE MORE CBP AGENTS, REDIRECT $15B DEMOCRAT IRS PAYDAY TO BORDER\\n\\n\"Our city is not served when New Yorkers with strong ties in the community are afraid to engage with law enforcement because they fear deportation. Today, we send another message to Washington that the time to act has come to provide relief to so many individuals who contribute to our nation’s growth,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said when the two laws were enacted.\\n\\n\"I’d like to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council for passing this legislation, which further establishes New York City as a leader in immigration reform.\"\\n\\nSimilar reforms continued under the de Blasio administration, including in 2017, when the City Council passed a bill prohibiting \"City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law.\"\\n\\n\"The de Blasio Administration today announced the issuance of citywide guidance and new NYPD protocols to clarify and institutionalize the City’s policy that it will not voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities, and will only coordinate in limited circumstances, including where there is a public safety risk,\" a press release from the de Blasio administration stated of the law at the start of 2018.\\n\\nBorelli, who has served on City Council representing portions of Staten Island since 2015, argued \"it\\'s interesting to see people trying to backtrack on the impact that these laws have on the cooperation between ICE and city law enforcement.\"\\n\\nGEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\\n\\n\"But the proof is in the pudding,\" he said.\\n\\nThe New York Republican pointed to comments made by local politicians when the laws were passed, arguing that Democrats wanted to sever communication between local law enforcement and federal authorities when involving illegal immigrants.\\n\\n\"The day we start helping ICE is the day we lose the public trust, which is why this guidance and protocol is so critical,\" a former NYC council member said in 2018, when de Blasio announced the prohibition of city agencies partnering with the Department of Homeland Security when related to immigration laws.\\n\\nCurrent New York City Mayor Eric Adams also supported the measure in 2018, when he served as Brooklyn borough president.\\n\\nLAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT\\'S SLAYING\\n\\n\"It is important for our police officers and City employees to have clear guidance and protocol on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement, especially considering the overaggressive behavior of ICE agents. Public safety for all of our residents must come first,\" Adams said, according to the de Blasio-era press release.\\n\\nFollowing Laken Riley’s murder, Adams said this week that he supports altering city laws that would open the doors to New York City officials working with federal authorities on immigration matters involving violent suspects or repeat offenders.\\n\\n\"I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,\" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.\\n\\n\"We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,\" the mayor added.\\n\\nAdams has repeatedly spoken out in support of keeping New York City as a sanctuary city, saying illegal immigrants in the Big Apple should not live in fear of receiving city services, such as attending a school, due to their immigration status.\\n\\nWhen asked about Borelli\\'s comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it\\'s time for \"tougher border policies.\"\\n\\n\"I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it’s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,\" de Blasio said.\\n\\nThe former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting \"Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,\" along with \"spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.\"\\n\\nBorelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a \"Trump agenda\" on immigration.\\n\\n\"This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn\\'t care,\" he said.\\n\\nBorelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws’ logic.\\n\\n\"It\\'s completely backfired when people start to question, ‘What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?’ There\\'s limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,\" Borelli said.\\n\\nLaken Riley’s murder has shocked many Americans and heightened outrage about the Biden administration’s border policies. More than 7 million illegal immigrants have flooded the nation since President Biden took office in 2021, a figure larger than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News Digital analysis previously found.\\n\\nRiley was reportedly so badly beaten during the murder that her skull was disfigured, investigators reported in an affidavit.\\n\\n\"He’s a sick puppy,\" Borelli told Fox Digital when asked about the brutal attack. \"[He] would not have withstood screening, we hope, if we had a proper system of vetting and deporting people.\"\\n\\nIbarra is in custody and was charged with the felonies of malice murder, murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing the death of another, as well as the misdemeanor of physically hindering a 911 call, according to the affidavit filed Feb. 23.\\n\\nLAKEN RILEY MURDER: MEDIA OUTLETS FOCUS ON LONE JOGGERS, DOWNPLAY SUSPECTED KILLER’S IMMIGRATION STATUS\\n\\nNew York State Senate Republicans on Wednesday announced the renaming of legislation that would allow local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE. The legislation will now be known as \"Laken\\'s Law\" in memory of Riley.\\n\\n\"Because of New York law, because of New York sanctuary state laws, local law enforcement do not notify federal immigration officials when they take someone into custody, even if they\\'re here — especially when they\\'re here illegally,\" Republican New York state Sen. Robert Ortt said at a press conference Wednesday.\\n\\n\"So, Laken Riley\\'s murderer, albeit an alleged murderer, was in custody, law enforcement custody, and he was released without notification to ICE, to federal authorities, because of policies and laws passed by Democrats here in New York State,\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOrtt argued that if legislation allowing law enforcement to work with ICE were in place back when Ibarra was arrested by the NYPD, Riley \"would be alive today.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not an opinion.

      "A group of Democrats who started a movement in opposition to President Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza sent a clear message in the Michigan primary, exceeding the amount of votes the group was aiming for and complicating the key battleground state ahead of this year's general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yesterday was a resounding victory,\" Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who joined the \"Listen to Michigan\" movement, said during a news conference Wednesday claiming victory for the movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comments come following the movement's push to have Democratic voters select \"uncommitted\" in Tuesday's Democratic primary surpassed the group's expectations, with just over 101,000 people selecting the option, according to Associated Press numbers as of Wednesday afternoon. That mark was more than 10 times the group's stated goal, which was to get 10,000 people, or roughly the same as the margin of victory in the 2016 election in the state, to select the option.\n",

      "Despite the apparent resounding success, Biden easily captured the state and gained 115 delegates while hauling in over 81% of the vote, further solidifying his grasp on the nomination and setting up a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,\" Biden said in a statement after the Michigan victory while warning that there is \"much left to do\" to defeat Trump in November. \"You’ve heard me say many times it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America. It’s never a good bet to bet against Michiganders either. This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together. I know that we will.\"\n",

Nevertheless, the spokesperson stressed that the campaign is still working hard to earn the votes of holdouts and will continue working towards peace in Gaza.\n",

      "But the movement started by Listen to Michigan may not be in Biden's rearview mirror after Michigan, with the group saying activists in future primary states have reached out about joining the cause.\n",

      "The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a \"bump stock\" device is a \"machine gun\" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires \"automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that \"bump stocks\" are machine guns.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,\" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,\" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Samuel Alito called that \"disturbing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,\" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.\"\n",

      "As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will \"bump\" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire \"automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,\" said Justice Elena Kagan. \"So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.\"\n",

      "The murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the \"direct result\" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,\" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Georgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia’s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border \"parole,\" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and \"charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,\" according to ICE.\n",

      "7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES\n",
      "\n",
      "The NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra's arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ibarra’s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "New York City, however, is a \"sanctuary city\" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.\n",

      "\n",
      "Under a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions. The DOC, for example, is only allowed to comply with an ICE detainer if it is accompanied by a warrant from a federal judge and if the suspect has been convicted of a violent crime in the last five years.\n",

      "\"I’d like to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council for passing this legislation, which further establishes New York City as a leader in immigration reform.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar reforms continued under the de Blasio administration, including in 2017, when the City Council passed a bill prohibiting \"City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The de Blasio Administration today announced the issuance of citywide guidance and new NYPD protocols to clarify and institutionalize the City’s policy that it will not voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities, and will only coordinate in limited circumstances, including where there is a public safety risk,\" a press release from the de Blasio administration stated of the law at the start of 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Borelli, who has served on City Council representing portions of Staten Island since 2015, argued \"it's interesting to see people trying to backtrack on the impact that these laws have on the cooperation between ICE and city law enforcement.\"\n",

      "\"I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,\" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.\n",

      "\"We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,\" the mayor added.\n",

      "When asked about Borelli's comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it's time for \"tougher border policies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it’s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,\" de Blasio said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting \"Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,\" along with \"spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Borelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a \"Trump agenda\" on immigration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn't care,\" he said.\n",

      "Borelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws’ logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's completely backfired when people start to question, ‘What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?’ There's limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,\" Borelli said.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Every American has a right to be critical of Mr. Trump’s politics—one of us ran against him in 2016,\" reads Bush’s op-ed, titled, \"Elon Musk and Donald Trump Cases Imperil the Rule of Law.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"…But equality before the law is precious, and these rulings represent a crisis not only for the soundness of our courts, but for the business environment that has allowed the U.S. to prosper,\" the opinion piece continued. \"If these rulings stand, the damage could cascade through the economy, creating fear of arbitrary enforcement against entrepreneurs who seek public office or raise their voices as citizens in a way that politicians dislike.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The column, which was co-authored by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, railed against the recent monthslong civil fraud trial against Trump, which resulted in a nearly $355 million fine and bars Trump from operating his business in New York for three years.

      "\"​​New York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S.\" the pair wrote. \"Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state’s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital.

      "\n",
      "\"One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,\" he said.

      "Yet after McConnell's announcement, gratitude poured in from both McConnell's allies and his critics. \"I’m grateful for his service.... I think Mitch's tenure has had many legacies.

      "McConnell said he intends to finish his current Senate term, which ends in January 2027.

This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.\\n\\nSALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY\\n\\nSeparately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.\\n\\nBiden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.\\n\\nNYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\\n\\n\"He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,\" a spokesperson said. \"He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.\"\\n\\nProponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.\\n\\nGEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\\n\\nAs a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered \"no\" when asked if \"undocumented immigrants\" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.\\n\\nIn his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.\\n\\nBut Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are \"inherently more unsafe.\"\\n\\n\"It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,\" he said.\\n\\nDHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.\\n\\n\"Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don\\'t mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,\" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\\n\\nMayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.\\n\\n\"But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,\" he said.\\n\\n\"And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,\" he said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThere are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.\\n\\n\"I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,\" Adams said on Tuesday.\\n\\nHe added, \"You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}}, {'title': \"Hunter Biden testifies he 'did not involve' his father in his businesses, calls impeachment inquiry 'baseless'\", 'top_image': 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1845517792.jpg', 'images': ['https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/1200/675/GettyImages-1845517792.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/70cf428c-7ff0-490e-ab16-fe41905f347d/3d9dabd8-54a1-48b4-92e9-b560bc09caa5/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/348/196/Supreme-Court.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/12/1200/675/AP23347595861026.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Haley-Trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1845517792.jpg', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/1200/675/AP23177027348831.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/mary_ellen_withrow.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/03/340/340/Brooke-Singman.png?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/348/196/GettyImages-1938768468-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-testify-did-not-involve-father-businesses-saying-impeachment-inquiry-baseless', 'date': 'Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:40:18 GMT', 'short_description': \"Hunter Biden testifies he 'did not involve' his father in his businesses, calls impeachment inquiry 'baseless'  Fox News\", 'text': 'Hunter Biden testified Wednesday that he \"did not involve\" his father in his businesses, while blasting House Republicans for having \"hunted\" him in their \"partisan political pursuit\" and impeachment inquiry into his father.\\n\\nHunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees.

Never.\"\\n\\n\"You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation.

You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,\" he continued in his opening statement.\\n\\nThe first son said that for more than a year, the committees \"have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. \"\\n\\n\"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,\" he testified.\\n\\nThe first son said House Republicans \"have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by\" past witnesses.

somewhat enthusiastic about Biden’s candidacy and that number stands at just 62% among Democrats.\\n\\nThe same number of registered voters, 32%, say they are at least somewhat confident in Biden’s physical and mental ability to be president.\\n\\nThe same poll shows that confidence in Biden’s abilities among Democrats has dropped significantly to 72% after standing at 91% in 2020.\\n\\nBIDEN APPROVAL PLUMMETS TO NEAR CARTER LEVEL: GALLUP\\n\\nThe Monmouth poll also shows Biden with a meager 39% approval rating and that he is under water on several issues with voters, including jobs, immigration and foreign policy.\\n\\nThe weak approval rating is backed up by other polls as evidenced by the Real Clear Politics average showing that his approval rating has been under 50% since August 2021.\\n\\nAccording to Gallup, Biden is significantly losing support from key demographics, including young voters, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\\n\\nGallup explained that most of the decline in Black voters referring to themselves as Democrats has been in the last few years.\\n\\nPOLL SHOWS BIDEN\\'S LEAD OVER TRUMP SHRINKING IN 2024 MATCHUP AS CONCERNS OVER PHYSICAL FITNESS GROW\\n\\n\"Most of the decline has been recent, with the net-Democratic ID for this group falling 19 points from a 66-point advantage in 2020,\" Gallup said. \"At that time, 77% of Black adults favored the Democrats and 11% the Republicans, so the 2023 findings represent an 11-point decrease in Democratic affiliation since 2020 and an eight-point increase in Republican affiliation.\"\\n\\nMainstream news outlets have taken notice of the enthusiasm numbers, including the New York Times editorial board, which wrote earlier this month that Biden \"needs to do more to show the public that he is fully capable of holding office until age 86.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAlso in February, prominent election handicapper Nate Silver warned that Biden is \"losing now and there’s no plan to fix the problems other than hoping that the polls are wrong.\"\\n\\nThe Biden campaign pointed Fox News Digital to \"several indicators of enthusiasm\" they have seen in favor of the president.\\n\\n\"In the Nevada primary, we saw higher turnout than 2008 – despite that being a far more competitive election,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said. \"The email from the First Lady after the Hur report was our best performing email since the launch.\"\\n\\nHitt also pointed to Biden winning \"more votes in NH as a write in candidate than Obama did in ‘12\" and highlighted that Obama was on the ballot and Biden wasn\\'t.\\n\\n\"January was our best grassroots fundraising month ever, we doubled the number of small-dollar donors from December,\" Hitt added. \"We brought in over $1M in donations following President Biden’s speech marking the anniversary of the January 6th insurrection.\"', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com',

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nFormer law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade\\'s personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn\\'t claim attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nBradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn\\'t recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade\\'s romantic relationship with Willis.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded \"absolutely\" in the text exchange.\\n\\nWhen confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter \"dang.\" But then he said he was \"speculating\" in those comments.\\n\\nFANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS\\n\\nAttorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on \"lies about your friends.\"\\n\\n\"Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?\" Rice asked.\\n\\n\"I could have had, I don\\'t know,\" Bradley responded.\\n\\nBradely said he couldn\\'t recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade\\'s relationship with Willis once with Wade.\\n\\nFULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR\\n\\nBradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an \"in-camera\" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nBradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn\\'t spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.\\n\\nBradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade\\'s divorce.\\n\\nMcAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley\\'s testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday\\'s testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.\\n\\nLawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an \"improper\" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Willis\\' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.\\n\\nFloyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.\\n\\nDuring their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.\\n\\nMichael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.\\n\\nThe crux of the defense\\'s case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.\\n\\nGEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON \\'IMPROPER\\' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE\\n\\nWillis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.\\n\\nThe defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.\\n\\nBoth Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired.

      "The White House is calling for \"sanctuary\" cities and jurisdictions across the U.S. to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in turning over criminal illegal immigrants for deportation, just as there is renewed scrutiny over such policies in the wake of several high-profile crimes committed by illegal immigrants who had previously been released by local law enforcement despite pleas from ICE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,\" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. \"When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.\n",
